# PDF-QA Agent

This project uses OpenAI's language model and LangChain to create a question-answering system that extracts and analyzes text from a PDF document. It retrieves answers to specific questions based on the content of the provided PDF and posts the results to a Slack channel.

## Project Structure

- **`agent.py`**: Contains the `CustomAgent` class responsible for initializing the language model, vector store, and agent, and getting answers to questions.
- **`tools.py`**: Defines the tools used by the agent, including text retrieval and answer generation.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for extracting text from PDFs, creating a vector store, and generating answers.
- **`main.py`**: Main script to run the PDF processing and post results to Slack.
- **`.env`**: Configuration file for storing API keys and other sensitive information.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You also need to set up an OpenAI account and a Slack workspace.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-qa-agent.git
   cd pdf-qa-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    bash
    ```
    Copy code
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    bash
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Making the Solution More Accurate and Production-Grade

## 1. Improving Accuracy

### 1.1 Improve Text Extraction
- **Advanced Tools:** Use more advanced tools like PDFBox to ensure accurate text extraction, especially for complex or poorly formatted PDFs.

### 1.2 Fine-Tune the Language Model
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the OpenAI language model on datasets specific to the domain of the PDF content to improve relevance and accuracy of answers through prompt engineering.

### 1.3 Optimize Vector Store Creation
- **Adjust Chunk Size:** Optimize chunk size and overlap during text splitting to ensure relevant information is retained.
- **Enhanced Embeddings:** Use domain-specific fine-tuned embeddings for better vector store accuracy.

### 1.4 Contextual Retrieval
- **Context-Aware Retrieval:** Implement retrieval methods that consider the broader context of the query, using frameworks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### 1.5 Robust Error Handling
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage cases like empty text extraction or irrelevant query results.

### 1.6 Enhance Query Understanding
- **NLP Techniques:** Use NLP techniques to paraphrase or summarize the query before searching the vector store for improved matching.

### 1.7 Post-Processing of Answers
- **Answer Filtering:** Implement post-processing steps to filter out irrelevant content and validate the accuracy of the generated answer against the source text.

## 2. Making the Code More Modular, Scalable, and Production-Grade

### 2.1 Modular Code Structure
- **Reusable Components:** Generalize functions and classes for reuse across different parts of the project.
- **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies like models and vector stores into functions or classes to increase flexibility and testability.

### 2.2 Scalability
- **Parallel Processing:** Implement parallel processing for tasks like text extraction to handle large documents more efficiently.
- **Database Integration:** Store vector stores and other data in a scalable database like Elasticsearch, rather than keeping everything in memory.

### 2.3 Production-Grade Practices
- **Environment Management:** Use environment variables and secrets management for API keys and sensitive information.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging at various levels and use tools like Prometheus for real-time monitoring.
- **Testing:**
  - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for isolated functions and methods.
  - **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between different modules.
  - **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure the system works as expected.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Use a CI/CD pipeline with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.
- **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation, including docstrings, comments, and a well-structured README.

### 2.4 Version Control and Code Review
- **Branching Strategy:** Use a strategy like GitFlow for managing feature development and releases.
- **Code Reviews:** Implement a peer review process to catch bugs early and maintain code quality.

By applying these practices, the solution will not only become more accurate but also easier to maintain, scale, and deploy in a production environment.
